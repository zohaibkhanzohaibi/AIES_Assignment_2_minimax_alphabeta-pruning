# Tic Tac Toe AI - Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe AI project!
This repository contains two Python implementations of Tic Tac Toe where an AI plays against a human using:

Basic Minimax Algorithm

Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

Both versions are compared in terms of efficiency by counting the number of minimax checks (evaluations) during gameplay.

# Key Differences

Feature | Minimax Only | Alpha-Beta Pruning
Speed | Slower for complex trees | Faster by skipping unnecessary branches
Number of Evaluations | High | Significantly lower
Code Complexity | Simple recursion | Slightly more complex with pruning conditions
Optimal Play | ✅ Always finds best move | ✅ Always finds best move
✅ Both algorithms always play perfectly.
♻️ Alpha-Beta just does it faster by avoiding redundant calculations!
